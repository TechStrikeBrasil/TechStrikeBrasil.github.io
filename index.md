# About

Hi there, I'm Daniel, and here's a bit about me:

- 👨‍💻 I have a passion for Machine Learning, and am always eager to explore a new possibility or tool.
- 🌐 During my full-time work, I enjoy crafting APIs and creating websites, turning my ideas into digital reality.
- 🏋️ I'm an advocate for an active lifestyle. You can often find me hitting the gym or going for a refreshing run to keep both my body and mind in top shape.
- ☕ I'm a coffee enthusiast, and I have a soft spot for La Pavoni. A good cup of coffee can make any day better.
- 📈 I'm also keen on analyzing companies and the stock market. It's fascinating to consider investment opportunities.
- 🏡 Inspired by "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" by Robert Kiyosaki, I've ventured into the world of real estate and made some investments along the way.

Feel free to reach out and connect if you share any of these interests or if you simply want to chat about the exciting worlds of tech, sports, or investments. I'm always up for a good conversation!

Looking forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new opportunities together.

Apart from thanking LLM's for helping me generate the above, below is a list of blog posts I will be writing.
