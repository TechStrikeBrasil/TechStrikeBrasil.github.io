# Enabling safer and more precise **Brain Surgeries**

The brain is notoriously difficult to access. Surgical access to the brain is however essential to deliver therapeutics, to perform biopsies or to place intracranial electrodes.


Neuro Access is a minimally invasive versatile surgical tool. It integrates innovative imaging and sensing technology to provide unparalleled access, vision and navigation within the brain.

Neuro Access works alongside existing neurosurgical equipment and can be easily incorporated into current surgical routines.
